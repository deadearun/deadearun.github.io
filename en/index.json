[{"categories":["tool"],"content":"1 Software Description   Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a non parametric method to evaluate the relative effectiveness of decision making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and outputs. It does not need to give weights and hypothetical distributions in advance, and can directly determine the structure of the production frontier through input and output data. As a cross field of mathematics, operations research and computer science, DEA method has been widely used in many fields.   Most researchers who are new to DEA will probably have deep doubts about this type of optimisation model and will not know where to start. If you want to thoroughly understand the mechanics of DEA models, you must master the knowledge of operational research, including how to build, solve and analyse optimisation models, which means a high learning cost. There are currently some software available on the market to handle DEA models, but the free software can only solve simple CCR/BCC models, which are simply not adequate for everyday research needs. This is the reason for the development of this software, which contains the current mainstream models in the field of DEA research, including basic efficiency models, super-efficiency models, network DEA models and dynamic Malmquist index analysis, and can handle situations where there are undesirable outputs.

The algorithm code is based on this solver and is sufficient to solve small to medium sized data set. As the algorithm implementation part of the software and the interface development function are both done by one person, some bugs will inevitably occur . If you encounter problems during your experience, or find errors in the calculations, please do not hesitate to contact me!
